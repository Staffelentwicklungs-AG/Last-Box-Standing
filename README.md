# Last-Box-Standing<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Fortnite / PUBG<br/>
Genre: 2D Top-Down Battle Royale<br/>
USP: 10 crates fight for survival as the map shrinks â€“ only one can remain.<br/>
Main focus: Randomized pickups, shrinking play area, basic AI.<br/>

Conception<br/>
Last-Box-Standing is supposed to be a fun, casual experience for players that enjoy the thrill of fast gameplay Battle-Royales like Fortnite or PUBG are famous for.<br/>
This time around you have a top down version of it, in which boxes smash smaller boxes to get boxes to hit other boxes with.<br/>
<br/>
Story<br/>
Bix Box gets smaller. Its smaller conscious boxes inside want to survive. But there can be only one. Explore the insides of Big Box, find and smash boxes to gather weapons and items, fight the other boxes until only you are the last box stand. <br/>
</br>
Setting<br/>
In Boxoverse, Big Box is filled with an environment of other boxes that contain items or weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
The players control Smol and try to survive their ever shrinking environment while the Smols try to destroy each other. Players will have to be on a constant run to find ressources necessary to fight other Smols with. The gathered materials can be assembled to different items and combinations, such as two swords and duct tape can be crafted into either a big sword or dual blades. 
The character uses different weapons armor pieces and items to fight other Smols, a repertoire of melee and ranged options.<br/>
<br/>
Character<br/>
Centerd in the canvas, moving with keyboard and mouse. Mouse cursor is used for aiming. Orientation as a whole. 
Leveldesign<br/>
Big Box should be a big place with different distinct areas. Assets in general will be boxy. Since Big Box shrinks in time, Assets in the Deadzone continue to fall apart from the world and if a character stays outside the Fight Zone, they will have a chance to return to it.
