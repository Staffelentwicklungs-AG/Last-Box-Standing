# Last-Box-Standing<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Fortnite / PUBG<br/>
Genre: 2D Top-Down Battle Royale<br/>
USP: 10 crates fight for survival as the map shrinks â€“ only one can remain.<br/>
Main focus: Randomized pickups, shrinking play area, basic AI.<br/>
